# Instructions

Create a **conference day** web application for the [2015 React conference](https://conf2015.reactjs.org/schedule.html).

Your goal is to complete the site in **two hours**.

- Use a modern React stack.
- Use the existing data from the website.
- The website should optimized for attendees. (No need for a checkout flow).

This is an **any% speed run**. We will judge results based on the depth and quality of the outcome. You are expected (and encouraged!) to use AI tools to compelte this task. In the in-person phase of the interview, we’ll ask you about the code, ask questions about the product decisions you’ve made, and implement a small new feature.
